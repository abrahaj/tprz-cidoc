        <h1>CIDOC-CRM Element Representation</h1>

        <p>This document is a basic concept evaluation for CIDOC-CRM. It presents the Entities and their properties which might be the initial attempt to a
          programmable way.</p>

        <p>
          The document mainly includes the presentation of
          <g:link controller="cidoc" action="index">entities</g:link>
          and the presentation of the overall
          <g:link controller="cidoc" action="properties">properties</g:link>
          .

        <span class="paragrapg_text">The "CIDOC object-oriented Conceptual Reference Model" (CRM), was developed by the ICOM/CIDOC Documentation
          Standards Group. Since September 2000, the CIDOC CRM is being developed into an ISO standard in a joined effort of the <a target="_self"
          href="http://network.icom.museum/cidoc/working-groups/crm-special-interest-group/">CIDOC CRM SIG</a> and <a target="_blank"
          href="http://www.iso.org/iso/technical_committee_contact.html?commid=48836">ISO/TC46/SC4/WG9</a>. Since September 2006 it has been accepted as ISO
          21127. On December 2014, a new version became available <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=57832">ISO21127:2014</a>.
          It represents an 'ontology' for cultural heritage information i.e. it describes in a formal language the explicit and implicit concepts and relations
          relevant to the documentation of cultural heritage. The primary role of the CIDOC CRM is to serve as a basis for mediation of cultural heritage
          information and thereby provide the semantic 'glue' needed to transform today's disparate, localised information sources into a coherent and valuable
          global resource.
